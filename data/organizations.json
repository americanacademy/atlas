In 1899 the name again was changed, to the Alabama Polytechnic Institute. Finally, in 1960 the name of the school was changed to Auburn University, a title more in keeping with its location, and expressing the varied academic programs and larger curriculum of a major university.\n\nToday, Auburn is one of the few universities to carry the torch as a land, sea and space grant university. Our fall 2015 semester enrollment was 27,287. Our students can choose from more than 140 degree options in 13 schools and colleges at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels.",

The goals of its members include the pursuit of medical knowledge, and the advancement through experimentation and discovery of basic and clinical science and their application to clinical medicine. Each year, individuals having attained excellence in achieving these goals, are recognized by nomination for membership by the Council of the Association. Their election gives them the opportunity to share their scientific discoveries and contributions with their colleagues at the annual meeting.",

We evaluated their current processes and systems then introduced newer tools, methodologies, and technologies such as Lean Office, Professional Project Management, Six Sigma, multifunctional networked office products, scalable software and new procurement options.As a result, APB created a sustainable business model addressing the evolution of global supply chain management requirements, diversity and inclusion requirements in large-scale construction projects, and other regulatory and compliance issues that pose a threat to the operational success of organizations.  The model is built on the principles of project management, process improvement, and cloud-based computing and allows for flexibility in designing solutions, innovation in the delivery of services, and reliability and consistency in benchmarking and reporting.Due to our strategic business partnerships and high customer retention, the company continues to grow, offering more services, including environmental management, carbon reduction, supplier validation, and conflict minerals management. Our solutions have been widely accepted and proven in the financial, manufacturing, technology, construction, environment, healthcare, government and professional services industries.",
