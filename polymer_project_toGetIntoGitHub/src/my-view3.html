We evaluated their current processes and systems then introduced newer tools, methodologies, and technologies such as Lean Office, Professional Project Management, Six Sigma, multifunctional networked office products, scalable software and new procurement options.As a result, APB created a sustainable business model addressing the evolution of global supply chain management requirements, diversity and inclusion requirements in large-scale construction projects, and other regulatory and compliance issues that pose a threat to the operational success of organizations.  The model is built on the principles of project management, process improvement, and cloud-based computing and allows for flexibility in designing solutions, innovation in the delivery of services, and reliability and consistency in benchmarking and reporting.Due to our strategic business partnerships and high customer retention, the company continues to grow, offering more services, including environmental management, carbon reduction, supplier validation, and conflict minerals management. Our solutions have been widely accepted and proven in the financial, manufacturing, technology, construction, environment, healthcare, government and professional services industries.",

MDRC is best known for mounting large-scale demonstrations and evaluations of real-world policies and programs targeted to low-income people. We helped pioneer the use of random assignment — the same highly reliable methodology used to test new medicines — in our evaluations. From welfare policy to high school reform, MDRC’s work has helped to shape legislation, program design, and operational practices across the country. Working in fields where emotion and ideology often dominate public debates, MDRC is a source of objective, unbiased evidence about cost-effective solutions that can be replicated and expanded to scale.",
